# Bo Shang

I am an upcoming Research Scientist in Civil Engineering at CUNY City College, affiliated with the [AI & Mobility Research Lab](https://yiqiao-li.github.io/). My work bridges robotics, control systems, and machine learning, with applications in traffic monitoring and automated bridge inspection. [Full CV](/cv/)

## Research Focus

My research advances agentic AI and robotics for transportation systems, emphasizing:
- Human-Robot Close Proximity Interaction (HRCPI)
- Crowd-Robot Flow Optimization
- Traffic-inspired protocols for safe, socially-aware navigation

Current topics include:
- Autonomous robotic decision-making
- Drone-based crack detection and measurement
- Bridge Inspection Robot Deployment Systems (BIRDS)
- UAS for infrastructure inspection
- Sensing for vulnerable road user monitoring
- Data analytics for structural health monitoring
