# Bo Shang

I am an Upcoming Research Scientist in the Department of Civil Engineering at CUNY City College, affiliated with the [AI & Mobility Research Lab](https://yiqiao-li.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersecting domains of robotics, control systems, and machine learning, with recent applications in highway traffic monitoring and automated bridge inspection. For more details, please see my [full CV](/cv/).

## Research Overview

I specialize in the intersecting domains of robotics, control systems, and machine learning.

My recent focus areas include:
- Automated crack segmentation and measurement based on drone cameras
- Bridge Inspection Robot Deployment Systems (BIRDS)
- Unmanned Aerial Systems for bridge inspection
