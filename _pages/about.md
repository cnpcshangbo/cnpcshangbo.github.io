# Bo Shang

I am a Research Scientist at the AI & Mobility Research Lab in the City College of New York (CCNY). My research focuses on AI-powered traffic monitoring, LiDAR-vision fusion for object detection, and data-driven transportation system analysis. I am particularly interested in developing multimodal sensing and deep learning frameworks for intelligent mobility and infrastructure safety. I have participated in various AI and robotics projects related to automated crack detection, bridge condition assessment, and LiDAR-based traffic data collection in collaboration with New York City agencies.

## Research Focus

My recent work explores 3D object detection and reasoning networks for complex urban scenes and data-driven approaches to support sustainable and intelligent transportation infrastructure.

Key areas include:
- AI-powered traffic monitoring
- LiDAR-vision fusion for object detection
- Multimodal sensing and deep learning frameworks
- Autonomous robotic decision-making
- Drone-based crack detection and measurement
- Bridge Inspection Robot Deployment Systems (BIRDS)
- UAS for infrastructure inspection
- Sensing for vulnerable road user monitoring
- Data analytics for structural health monitoring
